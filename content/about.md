# Hello!

I am a student in the [Department of Political Science at the University of California San Diego](https://polisci.ucsd.edu/undergrad/). I am currently pursuing a B.S. with a concentration in Data Analytics. 

I am currently an undergraduate research assistant at the UCSD Yankelovich Center for Social Science Research, where I study the impact of on-cycle city and local elections with federal or state elections. My interests span the broad field of political science, but I am especially curious about elections, political economic theories, and political behavior.
