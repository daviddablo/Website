# Hello!

I am a student in the [Department of Political Science at the University of California, San Diego](https://polisci.ucsd.edu/undergrad/). I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science with a concentration in Data Analytics. My minor is in Computational Social Science.

I am an undergraduate research assistant for Professor Thad Kousser, and currently co-authoring a paper on ethnoracial gaps in election trust. My senior thesis is a study on the poll watchers where I find that co-racial poll watchers and co-partisan poll watchers increase the trust of voters. It is available on request. Previously, I worked on data analysis of graduate admissions and undergraduate employment outcomes at the UC San Diego Institutional Research department. 

Feel free to connect with me [here](mailto:ddablo@ucsd.edu). Have a great day!
