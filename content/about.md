# Hello!

I am a student in the [Department of Political Science at the University of California San Diego](https://polisci.ucsd.edu/undergrad/). I am currently pursuing a B.S. with a concentration in Data Analytics. 

I am currently an undergraduate research assistant at the UCSD [Yankelovich Center for Social Science Research](https://yankelovichcenter.ucsd.edu/about/our-mission.html), where I study the impact of on-cycle city and local elections with federal or state elections. My interests span the broad field of political science, but I have curiousity about elections, political economic theories, and political behavior.

In my free time, my usual go-tos are playing the piano, taking photos, and browsing Zillow.

Feel free to connect with me [here](mailto:ddablo@ucsd.edu). Have a great day!
